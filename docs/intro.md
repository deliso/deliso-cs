# Welcome to My Learning Journey

Welcome to my personal study tracker! Here, I document my progress as I teach myself Computer Science. This site is a central hub where I keep all my study materials, notes, and progress tracking for the subjects I am learning.


## About This Project

This Docusaurus site is a work-in-progress documentation of my learning journey. It helps me stay organized and motivated, and I hope it might be useful to others on a similar path.
